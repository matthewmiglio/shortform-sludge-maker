(Well not new but well maintained) and I told myself I am NOT putting any dents in this car. Well, today I put a dent in and a bunch of scratches in it by getting to close to the pole in my parking space.\nUgh, why am I like this? I try to park right every time. I know how to park my car in my parking spot. And yet somehow this is the third time I've dented a car by getting to close to the pole in the covered parking spot. I always try to stay conscious of that pole in my parking spot since I've done this twice before but some how I just keep slipping up. I never use my phone while driving and I don't drink either. Sigh* what's wrong with me. Good thing I'm not a CDL driver.\nTLDR: I put a big ugly dent on my new car by hitting a pole for the third time.",
